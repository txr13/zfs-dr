# Changelog

## [x.x.x] - xxxx-xx-xx
## Changed
- Take ZFS snapshots even if the main or scratch directories are unavailable (and
  even if we're not configured to continue anyway).
- Transfer of archive to storage is done with cp and will not preserve ownership
  (prevents errors from moving across filesystem boundaries).

## Added

## Fixed
- Do not remove the temp directory if we throw an error on an inaccessible
  archive.

## Removed
- Since the script now takes snapshots regardless of whether the backup or temp
  directories exist, the setting to continue with a snapshot without a temp
  directory is meaningless.


## [0.2.0] - 2019-01-11
## Changed

## Added
- Licensed under the LGPL.
- Scratch / temporary directory can be set independantly of the storage directory.
- Compression and encryption can be toggled on and off independantly.
- Intermediate steps in compression and encryption can be deleted after each step
  instead of waiting until the end of the process.
- Added ability to disable automatic deletion of old archives (so the user can
  manage multiple cycles of backup archives manually, if desired).
- Script can now report errors and warnings through stderr.
- A missing predecessor archive will trigger a warning. If another zfs-dr scratch
  directory exists, the warning will indicate that a previous run may still be in
  progress. If there are no other scratch directories present, the warning will
  indicate that the user should examine the situation and manually re-export the
  relevant snapshots as needed.
- Added a prerequisite check to be sure dependencies are available.
- Added option to allow the script to continue making snapshots and exporting
  archives if the main storage directory and/or scratch directory is unavailable.

## Fixed
- Script previously assumed that a missing immediate predecessor snapshot indicated
  a need to use a higher-tier snapshot as a base, instead of checking for an earlier
  predecessor snapshot. (Example, if weekly2 was missing, previous versions would
  export weekly3 based off the monthly, instead of exporting based off weekly1.)
- Did not check whether snapshots had been exported to archival.
- Archive filenames are updated as each step is performed (leaner condition
  tests).
- Added explicit path for zfs command (fixes command not found when run from cron).


## [0.1.0] - 2017-11-17
